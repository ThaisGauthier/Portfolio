Welcome ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Creative Technology Student at the De Vinci Innovation Center, [DVIC](https://dvic.devinci.fr/). I am in my second year Master in the Resilient Future Group.

I am particularly interested in rethinking some technologies in order to make them more responsible. This leads to a review of the technologies by making them adaptable in a low-tech approach and using alternative materials, more responsible, with a strong determination to reduce the environmental footprint.

I'm currently working with:

-   Materials
-   Low-Tech
-   Design
-   Fashion
-   Modelization
-   Computer science
